# Gaming Clip Farming Bot — Brainstorming

Ideas, frameworks, and future directions that aren't current implementation priorities.
Nothing here is committed to — it's reference material for when the time comes.

---

## Future Archetypes (Not Current Scope)

**Lore Narration Shorts:** 20–60s narrated history or fictional lore (League, WoW, Warhammer; historical: mafia/gangsters/Yakuza, ancient empires). Slideshow style, AI voiceover (ElevenLabs), cinematic music. Higher CPM than gaming; strong brand deal potential.

**Interactive Poker Clips:** Short poker hands with hidden hole cards — viewer guesses the hand via multiple choice overlay. Requires CapCut (not FFmpeg) for interactive UI layers (countdown timer, elimination animation, reveal). Very high CPM. Data tagging system (hand type, action, result, hook format, engagement) feeds into existing Google Sheets analytics.

**Poker CapCut Template:** 9-track layout: base video → mask layer → question prompt → multiple choice UI → timer → elimination animation → reveal → result highlight → audio. Assembly time 2–5 min per video once built. Card masking tiers: manual coordinates → FFmpeg overlay from config → full OpenCV/YOLO automation (overkill initially).

## Systems Thinking — Filters and Templates

Filters and templates are two mechanisms for removing human decision points from a workflow so work becomes repeatable instead of constantly re-decided.

**Filters solve the selection problem.** They define what gets processed and what doesn't, based on rules — automatically. Without filters, someone evaluates every incoming item manually: should I act on this? That micro-decision, repeated at scale, is where most cognitive load accumulates.

Examples:
- Only process clips longer than 20 seconds with engagement above threshold
- Only route support tickets tagged "billing" to a specific queue
- Only ingest clips from streamers with ≥ 50k followers

**Templates solve the execution problem.** Once something qualifies, a template defines exactly how it gets handled — title format, editing steps, hashtag rules, posting schedule, required fields. Execution becomes filling in variables, not re-inventing the process each time.

**Together:**

> Filters reduce *what* you think about. Templates reduce *how* you think about it.

That combination creates scalability:
- New items flow in continuously — no manual sorting bottleneck
- Processing output is standardised — no variability from operator to operator
- Volume increases translate to throughput increases, not decision fatigue

The goal in any automated pipeline is to push as much work as possible into:

```
if condition_met → execute_predefined_action
```

### Layered Architecture

```
Input → Filter Layer 1 → Filter Layer 2 → Transform → Template → Delivery
```

**Filter layers narrow scope progressively:**

| Layer | Job | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Schema / validity | Only well-formed data enters | Format checks, duration minimums, resolution threshold |
| Business logic | Only high-value items proceed | Engagement score, profitability, rank threshold |
| Contextual | Only items matching current goal | Viral mode vs. retention mode vs. budget audience |

**Template layers handle output variation without multiplying complexity:**
- **Base template** — universal structure (hook → content → CTA)
- **Variant templates** — structural adjustments per context (short-form vs. long-form, TikTok vs. Shorts)
- **Dynamic fields** — placeholders filled from filtered attributes (tone, topic, score)

**The transformation layer** sits between filters and templates. Filters decide *what survives*. Transforms decide *what matters*. Templates decide *how it is expressed*.

**Separation of concerns is what makes this scalable.** Each layer is independently tunable. Each layer reduces complexity until the final step is almost trivial: fill structured fields and ship.

### Designing and Refining Combinations

Systems don't start with optimal filter-template pairings. They start with reasonable assumptions and improve through measurement.

**Stage 1 — Human-designed pairings.** Chosen by domain understanding: "high-engagement clips → viral short-form template." This already outperforms ad-hoc decision-making even before any optimisation.

**Stage 2 — Feedback loops.** Track outcomes: which filter thresholds produce better results? Which template gets higher retention? Adjustment becomes evidence-based. A/B testing and manual comparison work fine — no ML required.

**Stage 3 — ML (only when necessary).** Useful when there are too many combinations to test manually, or the system needs to adapt continuously. Conceptually it's the same loop — filter → transform → template → outcome → feedback → adjustment — ML just compresses the feedback and decision step.

**Filters and templates are coupled, not independent.** A filter is designed with a specific template in mind:
- "Fast viral short" template → filter for high-energy moments
- "Educational breakdown" template → filter for clarity and structure

**The scaling trick is constraint design.** Instead of 50 filters × 50 templates = 2,500 combinations, design 5 filters each mapped to 1–2 templates. The system becomes stable and predictable without needing intelligence overhead to manage it.

## Operating at Scale — Content as Structured Data

At the scale of **100+ short-form posts per day**, "clip farmers" usually stop thinking like creators and start thinking like **operators running a content distribution system**. The workflow becomes less about individual videos and more about **asset tracking, scheduling, analytics, and feedback loops**.

They typically keep everything organized by assigning each clip a unique record in a dashboard or database:

```text
clip_id | source_creator | game | template | platform | channel | post_time | url | views | retention | status
```

A common pipeline is:

1. ingest clip
2. process/edit
3. queue for upload
4. store returned post URL
5. collect performance data
6. compare performance by template/channel/platform

The minimum useful dashboard tracks:

- clip ID
- source file
- target platform
- account/channel
- scheduled time
- upload status
- post URL
- views
- engagement
- retention
- repost eligibility
- error logs

### Paid Tooling

Social media managers commonly use:

- **Hootsuite** / **Buffer** / **Later** / **Metricool** / **Sprout Social**

These provide multi-platform scheduling, post calendars, analytics, team workflows, link tracking, and approval systems.

### Open-Source / Low-Cost Stack

- **n8n** — automation and workflow orchestration
- **Airbyte** — pulling analytics from platform APIs
- **Metabase** — visual dashboards over a database
- **Grafana** — metrics and time-series monitoring
- **Supabase or PostgreSQL** — primary storage
- **Airtable** — lightweight content database (early stage)
- **Appsmith** — internal admin panels

A typical scalable open-source pipeline:

```text
yt-dlp → FFmpeg/Resolve → upload script → database → Metabase dashboard
```

or

```text
ingestion → queue → editor → uploader → analytics collector → dashboard
```

### The Dashboard as Control Panel

The dashboard often becomes the central interface, with clips organized by status:

- "ready to post"
- "posted"
- "underperforming"
- "viral"
- "recycle later"
- "copyright issue"
- "manual review"

At scale, operators usually rely on one of three dashboard styles:

| Style | Characteristics |
|---|---|
| **Spreadsheet** | Simple, works early; Airtable or Google Sheets |
| **Database dashboard** | Custom backend; better for large volume |
| **Kanban** | Visual queue management; clip lifecycle tracking |

Example lifecycle:

```text
Downloaded → Edited → Approved → Scheduled → Posted → Analyzed
```

### Posting Automation

Some teams build custom upload wrappers around platform APIs, browser automation, queue systems, and retry handling — because native social APIs often have limitations (rate limits, missing features, inconsistent behavior).

### Engagement at Scale

At high volume, most operators separate engagement by value:

**High-value:** top comments, repeat viewers, sponsors, potential leads — respond selectively.

**Low-value:** generic comments, spam, one-word replies — let pass.

Common approach:
- engage deeply on a few high-performing posts
- let most posts remain passive
- use analytics to decide where engagement actually moves the needle

Trying to reply to everything at scale feels robotic and doesn't compound. The better model:

```text
Automation handles posting
Human handles relationship
```

### Signals Worth Monitoring

- comment velocity
- save rate
- shares
- retention
- follows per post
- profile clicks
- conversion rate

### Recommended Stack for This Pipeline

For an automated pipeline like this one, the most practical open-source combination:

```text
PostgreSQL + n8n + Metabase
```

This gives automation, storage, visual reporting, low cost, and scalability — without proprietary lock-in.

**The key shift at scale:** you stop managing videos individually and start managing **content as structured data**. Every post becomes a data point for improving hooks, captions, templates, posting times, and platform selection.

## Algorithm-Aligned Content Strategy

### How Platform Distribution Works

Every post on TikTok and Instagram goes through a staged test:

```text
Small initial batch → measure behavior → expand if strong, die if weak
```

The only metrics that determine whether a post expands:

1. **Scroll-stop rate** (first 1–2 seconds) — did they stop instantly?
2. **Retention** (% watched) — did they finish?
3. **Rewatch / loop rate** — did it replay?
4. **Early engagement velocity** — likes, comments, shares in the first few minutes

Priority order: `Hook → Retention → Rewatch → Engagement`. Fail at step 1 or 2 and nothing downstream matters.

### FPS Clips: What Works

FPS content has a natural advantage — built-in excitement spikes.

**High-performing:** clutch moments (1v3, 1v5), fast kill streaks, "what just happened" moments, high-skill flicks/snipes.

**Low-performing:** slow buildups, context-heavy clips, long rotations, delayed payoff.

If the viewer doesn't understand the hype within 2 seconds, the clip fails.

### The Hook Problem

Front-load the moment:

- Bad: `setup → buildup → kill`
- Good: `kill → replay → continuation`

Techniques: start at the kill frame, add an instant subtitle ("1v4 clutch"), zoom on the first frame, audio spike immediately. The pipeline should enforce a hook within the first 0–1.5 seconds.

### Retention Engineering

Eliminate: dead air, static frames, slow pacing, silence, confusion.

Template rules:
- clip length: 6–20 seconds
- remove downtime between events
- slight zoom during action
- subtitles tightly synced

### Loop Optimization

Platforms reward loops. Design endings that connect back to the beginning — a replay that cuts to the clip's opening frame increases rewatch rate automatically without any extra effort.

### Scaling With Filters and Templates

**Filters** decide what gets posted: duration (5–30s), audio spike threshold, kill/event detection score. Only the top X% move forward.

**Template structure** (example FPS):

```text
0.0s   → action frame (hook)
0.2s   → zoom + subtitle
0–6s   → main action
6–10s  → replay or continuation
end    → loop transition
```

Together, filters and templates remove decision fatigue, enforce consistency, and align output with algorithm expectations.

### Posting as Experimentation

Each post is a data point, not a piece of content. Track: retention %, watch time, shares, follows per video.

Optimization loop: `Post → Measure → Adjust template → Repeat`

Multi-account strategy: separate game, style, and template per account so performance data is clean and comparable.

### Early-Stage Boost

Post when the target audience is active. Pin a comment; reply to 1–2 early comments. Hashtags and captions alone don't drive distribution — retention does.

### Automation Model

System handles: auto-select (filters), auto-apply template, auto-post, log metrics.

Human handles: template refinement, reviewing top performers, adjusting filter rules.

The long-term edge isn't posting more or fancier editing — it's **consistently passing the initial distribution test**.

## Clip Detection — What It Actually Means and How to Build It

Great clips are necessary but not sufficient. If detection is poor, nothing else matters. If detection is strong but hooks and editing are weak, clips still die in the first test batch. Detection needs to be paired with a template that guarantees a strong first 1–2 seconds.

### What "Optimized Detection" Actually Means

Not just "find kills." The real goal:

```text
High-signal moment detection
+ correct timing (start/end)
+ consistency across games
+ low false positives
+ low cost per clip
```

The objective: maximize the % of clips that pass the algorithm's first-stage distribution test.

### Paid / Subscription Tools

These are AI highlight generators, not raw detectors. They train models on highlight datasets and combine visual cues, audio spikes, and engagement patterns with continuous user-feedback refinement.

- **Eklipse.gg** — gaming-focused; detects stream highlights, auto-clips and exports
- **Sizzle.gg** — FPS/esports-oriented; AI + heuristics for exciting moments
- **Opus Clip** — general (not gaming-specific); targets "viral moments"
- **Medal.tv** — local detection via hotkeys and auto-clipping; less AI-driven

Downside: limited control, black-box behavior, harder to integrate into a custom pipeline.

### Open-Source Stack

No single tool handles everything — you build a stack:

| Tool | Role |
|---|---|
| OpenCV | Kill feed / HUD detection; template and feature matching |
| PySceneDetect | Scene change detection; useful for cuts/transitions |
| librosa / pydub | Audio analysis; volume and intensity spikes |
| OpenAI Whisper | Speech keyword detection ("clutch", "oh my god", reactions) |
| FFmpeg | Frame extraction, clip segmentation, preprocessing |

### How Multi-Signal Detection Works

Most systems are pipelines, not single models:

```text
Video
  ↓
Preprocess (normalize resolution + audio)
  ↓
Feature extraction (visual + audio + speech)
  ↓
Scoring engine
  ↓
Clip selection
```

Common scoring rules:

```text
score = (kills × 2) + (headshots × 3) + (audio_spike × 5) + (event_density × 2)
if score > threshold → keep clip
```

Context modifiers: late-game scenarios and clutch situations get score multipliers.

### Must-Have Features for a Custom Detector

1. **Preprocessing** — normalize resolution and audio levels before any analysis
2. **Multi-signal detection** — visual + audio + speech running in parallel
3. **Configurable scoring engine** — weighted rules with adjustable thresholds per game
4. **Clip boundary logic** — define start/end windows carefully; avoid cutting too early/late
5. **Deduplication** — skip already-processed clips
6. **Logging and metrics** — track scores, pass/fail rates, false positive rate

Example config shape:

```yaml
game: deadlock
kill_weight: 2
audio_threshold_db: -10
min_score: 8
```

### How Filters and Templates Help Detection

Filters simplify detection by removing low-quality input early (duration, resolution, audio threshold), reducing the search space, and stabilizing outputs. Templates help indirectly: if every clip starts near the action with consistent pacing, the scoring model is easier to tune and less likely to misclassify.

### Iterative Optimization

Detection improves through feedback:

```text
Detect → Post → Measure → Adjust weights → Repeat
```

High-retention clips → increase weight on their contributing signals. Low-retention clips → decrease. Over time the scoring model aligns with what the algorithm rewards, not just what looks exciting in gameplay.

### The Key Insight

Detection isn't about finding cool moments. It's about **finding moments that perform well in the distribution algorithm**. Most people optimize for gameplay excitement; the target should be viewer retention behavior.

## FFmpeg Beyond Cutting — Advanced Filter Techniques

The real power of FFmpeg is its filtergraph (`-filter_complex`), which treats video frames as raw data manipulable like a professional NLE. For FPS clips the goal is **information density**: removing dead space while highlighting mechanical skill and reaction time.

### High-Level Effects

- **Dynamic remapping (`remap`)** — pixel-map warping for lens correction or fish-eye POV; makes fast movement feel even faster
- **Motion interpolation (`minterpolate`)** — generates synthetic frames to smooth 30 FPS clips: `minterpolate=fps=60:mi_mode=mci:mc_mode=aobmc`
- **LUT color grading (`lut3d`)** — apply professional `.cube` LUTs instead of simple brightness/contrast adjustments
- **Audio ducking (`sidechaincompress`)** — automatically lower game audio when a kill SFX or streamer voice triggers

### Effects That Look Complex But Aren't

- **Dynamic zoom / Ken Burns (`zoompan`)** — programmatic zoom centered on a HUD coordinate at the moment a shot fires; use the `d` (duration) and `x`/`y` expressions to target the kill feed
- **Chroma key HUD isolation (`colorkey`)** — turn specific RGB values transparent to isolate and reposition UI elements like the kill feed or health bar
- **Progress bar overlay (`drawbox`)** — duration-tracking bar using the `t` variable to drive box width; no extra assets needed

### FPS Short-Form Power Combinations

The three filters most used by top FPS TikTok/Shorts channels:

1. **Vertical blur-stack (9:16 crop)** — duplicate the 16:9 clip, blur the background copy, center the original on top:
   ```
   [0:v]split[bg][fg];[bg]scale=384:684,boxblur=20:10[bgout];[fg]scale=384:-1[fgout];[bgout][fgout]overlay=(W-w)/2:(H-h)/2
   ```
2. **Kill-zoom** — 1.1× zoom triggered for ~0.5 seconds on a headshot; creates visual impact that syncs with game audio
3. **Crosshair / hitmarker overlay** — `overlay` filter with a custom high-contrast hitmarker PNG, making action legible on small mobile screens

### FPS Pipeline Cheat Sheet

| Function | Flag / Filter | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| Fast seek / cut | `-ss [time] -to [time]` | Cut VODs without re-encoding |
| Silence detection | `silencedetect` | Find dead air; auto-trim rotations |
| Metadata injection | `-metadata title="Clutch"` | Platform SEO tags before upload |
| Timestamp burn-in | `drawtext=text='%{pts\:hms}'` | Burn timestamps for reviewing gold sets |
| Hardware acceleration | `-hwaccel nvdec` | GPU decoding; ~10× faster than CPU |

### Companion Tools

| Tool | Role |
|---|---|
| OpenCV | Locates kill-feed pixels and hitmarkers; tells FFmpeg where to cut |
| yt-dlp | Pulls high-quality VODs from Twitch/YouTube |
| SoX | Advanced audio spike detection; finds the exact frame a weapon fires |
| ImageMagick | Generates dynamic text overlay PNGs ("Clutch", "Top 5") before FFmpeg layers them |
| Whisper | Generates `.srt` subtitle files that FFmpeg burns in via the `subtitles` filter |

## Managing FFmpeg at Scale — Library and Orchestration Patterns

### Filter vs. Filtergraph vs. filter_complex

- **Filter** — a single atomic operation (`scale`, `boxblur`, `transpose`); one input, one output
- **Simple filtergraph** (`-vf` / `-af`) — a chain of filters; one input, one output. Example: `scale=1280:-1,format=yuv420p`
- **filter_complex** — handles multiple inputs and multiple outputs; required for overlays, kill-zooms that split a stream into branches and merge them back, side-by-side compositions

### Community and "Marketplace"

FFmpeg has no centralized template store. Logic is shared as snippets:

- **GitHub Gists** — search `#ffmpeg-snippets`, `#ffmpeg-filter-complex`
- **Stack Overflow / SuperUser** — where complex filter logic is effectively traded
- **Reddit r/ffmpeg** — primary community hub
- **Doom9 Forums** — high-level video encoding veterans
- **VideoHelp Forums** — "how do I achieve this look" threads

Paid options exist at the abstraction layer, not the command level. Services like Shotstack and Creatomate are cloud APIs that wrap FFmpeg filtergraphs — you pay for the engine, not the command string.

### How Pros Manage Their Filter Library

Rather than storing commands in a document, experienced editors build modular components:

- **YAML/JSON config files** — store filter *parameters*; Python injects them into command strings at runtime (this is what `config.yaml` already does for templates)
- **HUD library** — normalized ROI coordinates per game (Warzone, Deadlock, Valorant) that define kill-feed position; updated when a game patches its HUD
- **Python/Node wrappers** — small functions like `apply_vertical_blur(input_file)` that abstract the raw FFmpeg string
- **Snippet managers** — Raycast, Alfred, or VS Code snippets for quick recall of standard commands (9:16 crop, loudnorm, etc.)
- **Docker images** — ensure custom-compiled filter builds (frei0r, vapoursynth) work consistently across machines

### The Orchestrator Pattern

At scale you don't run FFmpeg directly — you dispatch jobs:

1. **Selection** — a job manager picks a clip and reads its `game` tag
2. **Assembly** — pulls the corresponding `filter_complex` snippet from the library
3. **Variable injection** — replaces placeholders (`{{STRICTNESS}}`, `{{CROP_X}}`) with live values from config or the Market Density Monitor
4. **Execution** — the assembled command is dispatched to a worker

This is the pattern that makes templates reusable and the pipeline independent of any specific clip or game.

---

## ROI Standardization and Modular Filtergraphs

Treating video as a grid of data rather than an image is what makes clip processing scalable across games. Two systems enable this: a HUD coordinate library and a modular filtergraph template set.

### HUD Coordinate Library

In FPS games, HUD elements occupy fixed screen positions. Rather than hardcoding pixel coordinates in scripts, store them in config keyed by game and resolution:

```yaml
games:
  deadlock:
    resolution: 1080p
    roi:
      kill_feed:   [1450, 50, 450, 300]   # [x, y, w, h]
      ammo_count:  [1700, 950, 150, 80]
      weapon_icon: [1600, 950, 100, 80]
  marvel_rivals:
    resolution: 1080p
    roi:
      kill_feed:   [1500, 20, 400, 250]
```

This lets OpenCV and FFmpeg scripts read coordinates from config rather than being re-measured per game. When a game patches its HUD, one config update fixes every downstream script.

### Five Core Filtergraph Modules

A modular template is a collection of chainable functions, not a monolithic command string:

1. **Vertical blur-stack** — fits 16:9 gameplay into a 9:16 frame by blurring a scaled background copy
2. **Kill-zoom punch** — brief 1.2× scale-up centered on the crosshair during an event
3. **Dynamic subtitle burner** — takes an `.srt` file and applies a game-specific font/color style
4. **HUD overlay** — crops the kill-feed ROI and repositions it to screen center for mobile legibility
5. **Loop transition** — crossfade or wipe that blends the last 0.5s of a clip with the first 0.5s

### Weapon Detection via HUD Template Matching

Don't detect the weapon in the 3D world (hard — it moves). Detect the **weapon icon in the HUD** (easy — it's static).

Flow:
1. FFmpeg extracts a single frame from the middle of the clip
2. OpenCV crops to the `weapon_icon` ROI from the coordinate library
3. `matchTemplate` compares the crop against a reference PNG library
4. If confidence > 80% → returns `WEAPON_TYPE: SNIPER`
5. Job manager uses that tag to pull from a title list and injects it into upload metadata

Tools by approach:

| Approach | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Static HUD icon | OpenCV `matchTemplate` | Standard; works for fixed UI sprites |
| In-world weapon (3D) | YOLO object detection | Requires training on FPS images; significantly more complex |
| Text-based weapon name | Tesseract OCR | Reads text directly from HUD (CoD, Apex); no reference image needed |

---

## Modular Title Engine

The core idea: OpenCV reads the HUD to identify which gun or hero the player is using, then injects that name directly into the post title. A generic template becomes a specific, searchable, real claim about the clip.

**Example:**
1. Template library holds: `"The {weapon} is absolutely BROKEN right now"`
2. OpenCV crops the weapon-icon ROI and runs `matchTemplate` → identifies "Sniper Rifle"
3. Engine substitutes: `"The Sniper Rifle is absolutely BROKEN right now"`

Without the CV detection step, you're left posting generic titles ("This gun is broken") that are low-SEO and indistinguishable from every other gaming channel. With it, every clip auto-generates a title that names the exact weapon or hero — which is what viewers search for.

### How the Detection → Injection Pipeline Works

1. **OpenCV layer** — during clip processing, the Weapon Detector crops the HUD weapon-icon ROI and runs template matching against a library of 64×64 PNG reference images. The best match above a confidence threshold is written to `meta.json` as `weapon_detection.weapon_id` and `weapon_detection.display_name`.

2. **Context layer** — the Title Engine reads `meta.json` after all CV stages complete. It has access to: detected weapon/hero name, kill count, headshot count, sweat score.

3. **Selector layer** — maps CV signals to a title category:
   - headshots + multi-kill, or `sweat_score > 50` → `aggressive`
   - fallback → alternates `educational` ↔ `engagement_bait`

4. **Substitution layer** — picks a template from the selected category and fills `{weapon}` (and any other variables) using the CV-detected data:
   ```
   "Why every pro is switching to the {weapon}"
   → "Why every pro is switching to the Rail Gun"
   ```

### Template Categories

```yaml
categories:
  aggressive:
    - "The {weapon} is actually UNFAIR right now"
    - "Nobody talks about how strong {weapon} is"
    - "{kill_count} kills with {weapon} — this is insane"
  educational:
    - "Why every pro is switching to the {weapon}"
    - "The secret to mastering {weapon} this patch"
  engagement_bait:
    - "Is the {weapon} getting nerfed soon?"
    - "I can't believe this worked with {weapon}"
```

The same `{weapon}` placeholder also populates hashtags (`#SniperRifle`, `#Deadlock`) and the video description automatically — one CV read, multiple surfaces filled.

### LLM Hybrid (Optional Upgrade)

When template substitution isn't varied enough, pass the structured CV data to Claude instead of doing string interpolation:

- **Input:** `{"weapon": "Rail Gun", "kill_count": 4, "event": "headshot_streak"}`
- **Prompt:** "Write 3 viral short-form titles under 50 characters using these facts."
- **Why CV first:** The LLM is grounded in real detected data, so it can't hallucinate ("calling a sniper clip an SMG clip"). CV provides accuracy; LLM provides phrasing variety.

### What You Need to Build the Icon Library

- Save a 64×64 PNG crop of each weapon/hero icon from an actual game frame
- Place under `assets/weapon_icons/{game}/{weapon_id}.png`
- Add `weapon_id: "Display Name"` to `config.yaml → weapon_detector.games.{game}.weapons`
- The Weapon Detector handles the rest at runtime

### Preventing Repetition

- Title history is tracked per game in `assets/title_history.json` (last N templates used)
- The selector skips recently used templates before picking, so adjacent posts don't share the same hook
- 50+ weapon variables × 20+ hooks = 1,000+ combinations before any LLM involvement

## Proxy Signal Detection — Cheap Alternatives to Frame-by-Frame Analysis

Processing a full-resolution VOD frame-by-frame to find clips is computationally expensive. Professional systems avoid this by using proxy signals — data sources that are orders of magnitude cheaper than video but highly correlated with hype and action.

### 1. Chat Velocity (IRC Log Analysis)

Twitch chat messages are plain text. Processing 8 hours of chat takes milliseconds; processing 8 hours of video takes hours.

- Pull the IRC chat log for a VOD via the Twitch API
- Track messages per second; identify spikes, especially keywords: "LUL", "OMG", "???", "CLIP IT", "POG"
- Use spike timestamps as bookmarks — pass only those 30-second windows to OpenCV rather than the full VOD
- A sudden message-rate spike is a ~90% indicator that something clip-worthy occurred

### 2. Audio Peak Detection

Audio data is significantly lighter than video. Extract audio with FFmpeg `astats` or `showwaves`, measure dB levels, and flag windows where the peak exceeds a threshold. Silent or flat audio means no action. Loud spikes (gunshots, explosions, streamer shouting) correlate directly with highlight moments.

```bash
ffmpeg -i vod.mp4 -af "astats=metadata=1:reset=1,ametadata=print:key=lavfi.astats.Overall.RMS_level" -f null -
```

### 3. API Markers and User-Generated Clips

- **Stream markers** — many streamers press a physical "marker" button when something notable happens; pull these via `GET /helix/streams/markers` with the VOD ID
- **Viewer clips** — if viewers manually created clips during the stream, those timestamps are public; a cluster of manual clips at the same time stamp is a strong signal without any video analysis at all

### 4. Low-Resolution Pre-Scanning

When video analysis is necessary (e.g., kill-feed or weapon icon detection), downscale the VOD to 360p or 144p for the detection pass. OpenCV matchTemplate works equally well on low-res frames for HUD icons and UI elements, at roughly 1/10th the processing cost. Only upscale to 1080p for the final clip extraction.

### 5. Frame Skipping (Temporal Sampling)

Sample 1 frame every 2 seconds instead of every frame. For a 30-second clip: 1,800 frames vs. 15 frames. Once the weapon icon or kill-feed event is confirmed in a sampled frame, run high-detail analysis only on that specific window.

### The Funnel Approach

```text
1. Chat log scan       → identify ~10 hype moments    (cost: near zero)
2. Audio spike check   → confirm energy at those moments (cost: very low)
3. Low-res OpenCV scan → weapon/kill detection at 360p   (cost: low)
4. 1080p clip extract  → FFmpeg cut only the winners     (cost: moderate)
```

This funnel reduces computational cost by ~95% compared to scanning the full VOD at native resolution.

## Montage Assembly — Multi-Clip Concatenation

Stringing approved clips into a short montage creates a second content format from the same asset pool with minimal extra work. A 4-clip montage at 10–15 seconds per clip fits comfortably in a 45–60 second Short or TikTok.

### Transition Choice: Hard Cut

Hard cut (no transition) is the industry standard for FPS short-form montages. Crossfades and wipes interrupt the dopamine loop — any visual transition longer than ~2 frames gives the viewer a chance to scroll.

**The one exception that works:** a 1–2 frame white or black flash between clips. Fast enough to maintain pace, explicit enough to signal a new clip is starting. Used as the default in this pipeline.

**The real transition is audio:** cutting on the beat of a background music track matters more than any visual effect. A hard cut that lands on a snare or bass hit feels completely smooth. If a replacement track is configured (`audio.mode: "replace"`), cuts should be beat-aligned where possible.

### Clip Selection

Pull from `accepted/{game}/` — clips that have already passed manual review. Order by `kill_feed.sweat_score` descending (highest action first), fall back to recency if kill_feed data is unavailable.

### Pipeline Integration

Montage assembly runs as a separate trigger (`python run.py --montage`), not as part of the per-clip pipeline. Output goes through the review UI before distribution so the assembled montage can be approved or rejected as a unit.

## Audio Event Detection — DSP-Based Kill and Highlight Detection

Whisper is a speech-to-text engine — it tells you what was *said*, not what sounds occurred. To detect kills, headshots, multi-kills, victory/defeat, and game objectives from audio you need Digital Signal Processing (DSP): analysis of the shape of the sound wave itself, not its words.

### Why Audio Before OpenCV

Audio data is orders of magnitude smaller than video. Running audio analysis first means you can discard boring segments before OpenCV ever touches a frame. The cost funnel:

1. **Audio spike detection** — is there any action in this window? (milliseconds, no GPU)
2. **OpenCV kill-feed** — confirm visually at the spike timestamps only
3. **Whisper** — transcribe only confirmed highlights

### The Z-Score Method (No Paid APIs Needed)

Don't just look for "loud" moments — some streamers are always loud. Look for *relative* spikes above the clip's own baseline:

1. Compute rolling RMS (average loudness) over a 60-second window
2. Flag any 1-second window that is ≥ 3 standard deviations above that baseline
3. Apply a bandpass filter to isolate the frequency range of game sounds (kills/headshots live in the 800–4000 Hz "treble" band; explosions live in the 50–500 Hz "bass" band)

### FFmpeg-Only vs Python Audio Libraries

| Approach | What it can do | New dependency |
|---|---|---|
| **FFmpeg `astats` filter** | Per-frame RMS/peak dB log, parseable with Python | None |
| **FFmpeg + numpy/scipy** | Z-score, bandpass filter, full spike detection | numpy (likely already installed) |
| **Librosa** | Onset detection, spectrogram template matching, beat alignment | `librosa` (~50 MB) |

The FFmpeg + numpy path covers kill/headshot/objective spike detection with no new ML dependencies. Librosa adds spectrogram "audio fingerprinting" — recording the exact headshot sound in isolation and cross-correlating against the clip, similar to weapon icon template matching but for audio.

### Audio Fingerprinting (Spectrogram Template Match)

For games with distinctive sounds (e.g. Deadlock soul orb pickup, Marvel Rivals ultimate activation), you can record that sound as a reference WAV, compute its spectrogram, and slide it across the clip's spectrogram looking for a match — the same concept as `cv2.matchTemplate` but in the frequency-time domain. Near 100% precision for known sounds.

### Detected Event Types

- **Kill / headshot** — sharp transient spike in the 800–4000 Hz band
- **Multi-kill / ace** — cluster of spikes within a short window (≤ 5 seconds apart)
- **Victory / defeat** — sustained loudness change with low-frequency content (music swell, crowd cheer)
- **Objective capture** — game-specific audio cue; requires fingerprint reference clip

### Pipeline Position

Runs after ingestion, before kill-feed OpenCV — feeding spike timestamps into kill-feed so OpenCV only samples frames at audio-confirmed action windows instead of the full clip.

## Audio-First VOD Mining — Industry Pattern

Audio as a primary filter for highlight discovery is a proven production pattern used by high-end clipping platforms (Insights.gg, Tencent Game Video Analyzer) to keep server costs viable at scale.

**Core principle:** Video decoding is GPU-heavy and slow. Audio scanning is CPU-only and fast. Scanning an hour of audio for volume/frequency spikes takes seconds; scanning the same hour of video takes minutes of intense work. By running audio first you can discard 90–95% of a VOD — the "walking simulator" segments — before a single video frame is decoded.

### The Funnel

| Stage | Signal | Cost | What it discards |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Audio spike detection | Lowest | Boring stretches — no action sounds |
| 2 | OCR / kill-feed visual check | Medium | False audio positives (jump scares, BGM) |
| 3 | AI scoring | Highest | Clips that are visually interesting but not viral-quality |

### Acoustic Signatures Worth Detecting

- **Volume spike** — sudden loudness vs. rolling baseline (already implemented)
- **Pitch shift** — caster/streamer excitement; rising pitch = escalating action
- **MFCCs** (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) — frequency fingerprint that distinguishes a menu click from a sniper shot at the waveform level; used by Librosa and most professional audio classifiers

### Known Limitations

- **Streamer scream problem** — audio spikes can be a jump scare or dropped coffee, not a kill; visual verification is still the final authority
- **BGM interference** — loud background music buries mechanical game sounds; bandpass filtering (800–4000 Hz) partially solves this
- **Silent clutches** — some of the best moments (1v5 ninja defuse, quiet sniper play) have no audio signal at all; audio-first would miss them without a visual fallback

### Future Application: Full VOD Ingestion

The current pipeline ingests pre-clipped Twitch clips (already 30–60s). The full payoff of audio-first comes when ingesting full VODs — extract an 8kHz mono audio proxy (~1/100th the file size), spike-detect the whole stream in seconds, download only the ±10s windows around hits. Allows mining 10× more streamers for the same bandwidth budget.
