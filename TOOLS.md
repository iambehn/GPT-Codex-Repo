## Ingestion

### yt-dlp
**Stage:** Ingestion  
**Status:** IN USE  
**Cost:** Open Source  
**What it does:** Downloads video and audio from 1000+ sites (YouTube, Twitch VODs, Twitter/X, Reddit, etc.) via CLI. Successor to youtube-dl with active maintenance and faster development.  
**Pipeline fit:** Primary download engine. Called by the Ingestion stage to pull source clips by URL or batch list. Outputs to `raw/` directory.  
**Notes:** https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp — supports cookies, rate limiting, format selection, SponsorBlock, and metadata extraction. JSON metadata output (`--write-info-json`) feeds directly into our source manifest.

---

### gallery-dl
**Stage:** Ingestion  
**Status:** CONSIDERING  
**Cost:** Open Source  
**What it does:** Downloads image and media galleries from 200+ sites (Reddit, Imgur, Twitter/X, Pixiv, etc.).  
**Pipeline fit:** Supplementary ingestion for image-heavy sources or Reddit posts that link to clips not handled by yt-dlp.  
**Notes:** https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl — JSON metadata output; supports cookies and rate limiting.

---

### streamlink
**Stage:** Ingestion  
**Status:** CONSIDERING  
**Cost:** Open Source  
**What it does:** Extracts stream URLs from live streaming services (Twitch, YouTube Live, etc.) and pipes them to a local video player or file.  
**Pipeline fit:** Live stream capture — record Twitch VODs or live streams directly to `raw/` for later processing.  
**Notes:** https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink — pairs with FFmpeg for recording (`streamlink <url> best -o output.mp4`).

---

### Medal.tv
**Stage:** Ingestion  
**Status:** RESEARCH ONLY  
**Cost:** Free (platform); no public automation API  
**What it does:** Gaming clip sharing platform with automatic highlight detection for PC games via a client overlay.  
**Pipeline fit:** Potential clip source — users share short gaming moments here.  
**Notes:** No public CLI or download API. Web scraping would violate ToS. Clips discovered here would need to be ingested manually or via yt-dlp if they surface on YouTube/Twitter.  
**Reason not using:** No automatable ingestion path; platform-only consumption.

---

## Transcription

### Whisper
**Stage:** Transcription  
**Status:** IN USE  
**Cost:** Open Source  
**What it does:** OpenAI's speech recognition model. Transcribes audio to text with timestamps at the segment level. Runs locally.  
**Pipeline fit:** Transcription stage reads audio track from ingested clip and outputs SRT/JSON with segment timestamps used for caption burn-in and AI scoring context.  
**Notes:** https://github.com/openai/whisper — models range from `tiny` (fast, less accurate) to `large-v3` (slow, most accurate). `medium` is a practical default for gaming audio.

---

### faster-whisper
**Stage:** Transcription  
**Status:** CONSIDERING  
**Cost:** Open Source  
**What it does:** Drop-in reimplementation of Whisper using CTranslate2. 4x faster inference than the original at the same accuracy, with lower memory usage.  
**Pipeline fit:** Direct replacement for Whisper in the Transcription stage — same output format, significantly faster on CPU and GPU.  
**Notes:** https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper — strong candidate to replace Whisper once pipeline is stable.

---

### WhisperX
**Stage:** Transcription  
**Status:** CONSIDERING  
**Cost:** Open Source  
**What it does:** Extends Whisper with forced alignment to produce word-level timestamps (not just segment-level).  
**Pipeline fit:** Required if we implement word-highlight caption style (each word lights up as spoken). Segment-level timestamps from vanilla Whisper are too coarse for this effect.  
**Notes:** https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX — depends on `pyannote.audio` for alignment; requires a Hugging Face token for the alignment model. Segment-level Whisper is the chosen approach for the initial build; WhisperX is the planned upgrade path when word-highlight captions are implemented.

---

### stable-ts
**Stage:** Transcription  
**Status:** CONSIDERING  
**Cost:** Open Source  
**What it does:** Modifies Whisper's internal processing to produce more accurate word and segment timestamps, especially around silences and music.  
**Pipeline fit:** Drop-in improvement over vanilla Whisper timestamps without changing the rest of the transcription pipeline.  
**Notes:** https://github.com/jianfch/stable-ts — compatible with faster-whisper; can be combined with WhisperX.

---

## Feature Extraction

### FFprobe
**Stage:** Feature Extraction  
**Status:** IN USE  
**Cost:** Open Source (ships with FFmpeg)  
**What it does:** CLI tool that reads media file metadata: codec, resolution, frame rate, duration, audio streams, bitrate, and more.  
**Pipeline fit:** Called after ingestion to populate `source_metadata` fields in the clip manifest (resolution, fps, duration, has_audio). Zero additional install cost — included with FFmpeg.  
**Notes:** JSON output via `ffprobe -v quiet -print_format json -show_streams -show_format`.

---

### PySceneDetect
**Stage:** Feature Extraction  
**Status:** CONSIDERING  
**Cost:** Open Source  
**What it does:** Detects scene changes and cuts in video using content-aware (histogram diff) or threshold-based algorithms.  
**Pipeline fit:** Generates `motion_level` and `scene_change_count` fields in the feature manifest. High scene-change density correlates with action highlights.  
**Notes:** https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect — Python API and CLI; outputs CSV or JSON scene list. Can export scene images for thumbnail candidates.

---

### OpenCV
**Stage:** Feature Extraction  
**Status:** NOT USING  
**Cost:** Open Source  
**What it does:** Computer vision library for frame-level analysis: optical flow, object detection, motion estimation, color analysis.  
**Pipeline fit:** Could generate motion vectors and per-frame energy scores.  
**Reason not using:** PySceneDetect covers the motion detection need with far less complexity and no ML model overhead. OpenCV would be warranted only if we add object detection (e.g., HUD element recognition) — deferred until needed.

---

## Processing

### FFmpeg
**Stage:** Processing (primary), Ingestion (remux), Distribution (final encode)  
**Status:** IN USE  
**Cost:** Open Source  
**What it does:** Industry-standard CLI tool for video/audio encoding, decoding, filtering, muxing, and streaming. Stateless — one command per job.  
**Pipeline fit:** Core processing engine for all clip operations: lossless trim (`-c copy`), vertical fill (blur background + foreground composite), caption burn-in (subtitles filter), zoom punch (`zoompan` filter), loudness normalization, format conversion, and final social media encode.  
**Notes:** https://ffmpeg.org — comprehensive filter graph system. `libx264`/`libx265` for H.264/H.265 output. `-crf` controls quality/size tradeoff.

---

### Shutter Encoder
**Stage:** Processing (batch encode)  
**Status:** NOT USING  
**Cost:** Free (open source, Java)  
**What it does:** GUI-based batch video converter built on top of FFmpeg and HandBrake. Provides a visual preset library for encoding jobs.  
**Pipeline fit:** Useful for manual batch re-encoding passes or testing encode presets before codifying them as FFmpeg commands. Not part of the automated pipeline — operator-facing tool.  
**Notes:** https://www.shutterencoder.com — Windows/Mac/Linux. No CLI automation; interaction is through the GUI.  
**Reason not using:** FFmpeg is the permanent processing engine. Shutter Encoder is a GUI wrapper with no CLI automation path — it adds no capability to a scripted pipeline.

---

### HandBrake
**Stage:** Processing (final compression)  
**Status:** CONSIDERING  
**Cost:** Open Source  
**What it does:** Video transcoder with a well-tuned preset library, particularly for H.264/H.265 output targeting specific device profiles and file sizes.  
**Pipeline fit:** Optional final compression pass after FFmpeg assembly — HandBrake's `--preset` system can produce slightly smaller files at equivalent quality for upload. Also has a CLI (`HandBrakeCLI`) for automation.  
**Notes:** https://handbrake.fr — `HandBrakeCLI` is the automation path. Evaluate whether FFmpeg CRF output is already sufficient before adding this step.

---

### LosslessCut
**Stage:** Manual Review (operator tool)  
**Status:** CONSIDERING  
**Cost:** Free (open source)  
**What it does:** GUI tool for fast, lossless trimming of video files by cutting at keyframes without re-encoding.  
**Pipeline fit:** Operator use during the Manual Review stage — quickly trim a clip to precise in/out points before approving it for processing. Output feeds back into the pipeline as a pre-trimmed source.  
**Notes:** https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut — Electron app, Windows/Mac/Linux. Not part of automated pipeline.

---

### mkvtoolnix
**Stage:** Ingestion (pre-processing)  
**Status:** CONSIDERING  
**Cost:** Open Source  
**What it does:** Tools for creating, modifying, and inspecting MKV files. `mkvmerge` can remux MKV → MP4 without re-encoding.  
**Pipeline fit:** Some sources (Twitch VOD downloads) arrive as `.mkv`. FFmpeg can handle MKV but remuxing to MP4 first avoids edge cases with container metadata in subsequent FFmpeg filter chains.  
**Notes:** https://mkvtoolnix.download — `mkvmerge -o output.mp4 input.mkv` for lossless remux.

---

### MoviePy
**Stage:** Processing  
**Status:** NOT USING  
**Cost:** Open Source  
**What it does:** Python library for programmatic video editing: clip trimming, concatenation, compositing, text overlays, audio manipulation, and frame-level effects. Wraps FFmpeg under the hood.  
**Pipeline fit:** Could replace direct FFmpeg subprocess calls with a higher-level Python API.  
**Reason not using:** Re-encodes at every operation by default — lossless trim operations that FFmpeg handles via `-c copy` in milliseconds become full re-encodes in MoviePy. Memory-heavy for long source clips (loads frames into RAM). `TextClip` requires ImageMagick as a separate fragile dependency. Raw FFmpeg subprocess calls give more control over codec, CRF, and filter graph settings for the operations this pipeline needs.

---

### Remotion
**Stage:** Processing  
**Status:** NOT USING  
**Cost:** Open Source (free for personal use; commercial license for companies)  
**What it does:** React/TypeScript framework for rendering videos programmatically — define video compositions as React components, render to MP4 via headless Chrome.  
**Pipeline fit:** Could generate title cards, animated overlays, and template-driven sequences.  
**Reason not using:** JavaScript/React-based — wrong language for this Python pipeline. Headless Chrome rendering is heavy and slow compared to FFmpeg filter chains for the same output.

---

### DaVinci Resolve
**Stage:** Processing (color grading, NLE timeline assembly)  
**Status:** RESEARCH ONLY  
**Cost:** Free tier (limited scripting); Studio ~$295 one-time  
**What it does:** Professional NLE with a color grading node graph, Fusion compositing engine, and a Python scripting API for render queue automation.  
**Pipeline fit:** Would enable template-driven LUT-based color grading and complex multi-clip timeline assembly beyond FFmpeg's filter graph capabilities.  
**Reason not using:** Free tier does not support external Python scripting (Studio license required). Python API has significant gaps: cannot programmatically build color nodes, no direct API for zoom/transitions/effects (requires pre-made DRX/Fusion macro files), and silent failures (returns `False`/`None` without error messages). FFmpeg is sufficient for social media clip quality at this scale. Revisit if professional color grading becomes a requirement.

---

## Audio

### Auphonic
**Stage:** Processing (audio normalization)  
**Status:** CONSIDERING  
**Cost:** Free tier (2 hrs/mo); ~$11/mo for 9 hrs  
**What it does:** Automated audio post-production service: loudness normalization (LUFS targeting), noise reduction, leveling, and encoding via API.  
**Pipeline fit:** Optional audio processing step after clip trim — normalize loudness to platform specs (YouTube: -14 LUFS, TikTok: -14 LUFS) before final encode.  
**Notes:** https://auphonic.com — REST API available; outputs normalized audio file. Evaluate whether FFmpeg's `loudnorm` filter is sufficient before adding this dependency.

---

### RX by iZotope
**Stage:** Audio repair  
**Status:** RESEARCH ONLY  
**Cost:** Subscription (~$99–$499/yr depending on tier)  
**What it does:** Industry-standard audio repair suite: de-noise, de-click, de-reverb, dialogue isolation, and spectral repair.  
**Pipeline fit:** Would improve audio quality for clips with background noise, game audio bleed, or mic issues.  
**Reason not using:** No automation API — manual-only workflow via standalone app or DAW plugin. Subscription cost not justified until audio quality is a proven bottleneck.

---

### Epidemic Sound
**Stage:** Distribution (background music)  
**Status:** CONSIDERING  
**Cost:** Subscription (~$15/mo personal, ~$49/mo commercial)  
**What it does:** Royalty-free music library with streaming platform clearance — tracks won't trigger Content ID claims on YouTube, TikTok, or Instagram.  
**Pipeline fit:** Background music layer for clips that need energy boost. Track selected by template `audio.background_music_id` field.  
**Notes:** https://www.epidemicsound.com — API available for licensed subscribers; track search by mood/genre/BPM.

---

### Artlist
**Stage:** Distribution (background music)  
**Status:** CONSIDERING  
**Cost:** Subscription (~$199/yr)  
**What it does:** Royalty-free music and SFX library with lifetime licensing — one annual subscription covers all content created that year permanently.  
**Pipeline fit:** Alternative to Epidemic Sound. Lifetime license model is better value if clip volume is high.  
**Notes:** https://artlist.io — no public API; track selection would be manual or via a curated ID list in templates.

---

## AI Scoring

### Claude API
**Stage:** AI Scoring  
**Status:** IN USE  
**Cost:** Token-based (~$3–15 per million tokens depending on model)  
**What it does:** Anthropic's Claude models via API. Multimodal (text + vision) — can analyze transcripts, metadata, and video frames to score clip quality and generate titles/descriptions.  
**Pipeline fit:** AI Scoring stage sends clip transcript + metadata to Claude with a scoring prompt. Returns structured JSON with `highlight_score`, `clip_type`, suggested title, and caption text.  
**Notes:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet or Claude 3 Haiku for cost efficiency. Vision input enables frame-level analysis without a separate model.

---

### GPT-4o
**Stage:** AI Scoring  
**Status:** CONSIDERING  
**Cost:** Token-based (~$5–15 per million tokens)  
**What it does:** OpenAI's multimodal model. Same use case as Claude API — transcript + metadata scoring with optional vision input.  
**Pipeline fit:** Drop-in alternative to Claude API in the AI Scoring stage. Both produce structured JSON output.  
**Notes:** Evaluate on accuracy vs. cost for the specific scoring prompt. Claude and GPT-4o can be A/B tested against the same ground truth labels.

---

### LangChain
**Stage:** AI Scoring / Orchestration  
**Status:** NOT USING  
**Cost:** Open Source  
**What it does:** Framework for building LLM-powered applications with chains, agents, memory, and tool use.  
**Pipeline fit:** Could orchestrate multi-step AI scoring workflows.  
**Reason not using:** Overhead not justified at current scale. Direct API calls to Claude or GPT-4o with a structured prompt are simpler, more debuggable, and faster to iterate on than a LangChain abstraction layer.

---

## Review UI

### Flask
**Stage:** Manual Review  
**Status:** IN USE  
**Cost:** Open Source  
**What it does:** Lightweight Python web framework for building server-side web applications and REST APIs.  
**Pipeline fit:** Backend for the Manual Review UI — serves clip data, accepts approve/reject/edit actions, updates the clip manifest.  
**Notes:** Minimal footprint; good for a simple review dashboard. Pair with HTMX or a lightweight JS frontend to avoid a full SPA.

---

### FastAPI
**Stage:** Manual Review / Pipeline API  
**Status:** NOT USING  
**Cost:** Open Source  
**What it does:** Modern Python web framework with automatic OpenAPI docs, async support, and Pydantic data validation.  
**Pipeline fit:** Alternative to Flask for the Review UI backend. Better choice if the pipeline exposes a REST API for external integrations (n8n webhooks, mobile review app).  
**Notes:** https://fastapi.tiangolo.com — async support is useful if the review UI needs to stream video or handle concurrent requests.  
**Reason not using:** Flask selected for the Manual Review UI. FastAPI's async benefits and auto-docs aren't needed at this scale.

---

### Streamlit
**Stage:** Review UI  
**Status:** NOT USING  
**Cost:** Open Source  
**What it does:** Python framework for building data dashboards and ML demos with minimal frontend code.  
**Pipeline fit:** Could display clip metrics and scoring outputs as a dashboard.  
**Reason not using:** No native video player component with editing controls (in/out trim markers, approve/reject buttons per clip). Streamlit is designed for data visualization, not interactive video review workflows.

---

## Distribution

### n8n
**Stage:** Distribution / Workflow Automation  
**Status:** NOT USING  
**Cost:** Open Source (self-hosted free); Cloud ~$24/mo  
**What it does:** Self-hosted workflow automation platform (similar to Zapier/Make but open source). Connects apps and APIs via a visual node editor.  
**Pipeline fit:** Watch folder → detect approved clips → trigger upload to TikTok/YouTube Shorts/Instagram Reels → log result. Keeps distribution logic out of the Python codebase.  
**Notes:** https://n8n.io — 400+ integrations. Docker-deployable. Webhook nodes can receive events from the pipeline.  
**Reason not using:** Direct platform API calls chosen for distribution. n8n overhead (separate service, visual editor, Docker) isn't justified at current scale.

---

### Buffer
**Stage:** Distribution (social scheduling)  
**Status:** CONSIDERING  
**Cost:** Free tier (3 channels); ~$6/mo per channel  
**What it does:** Social media scheduling tool with a REST API for programmatic post creation and queue management.  
**Pipeline fit:** Schedule approved clips for optimal posting times rather than posting immediately. API call at the end of the distribution stage enqueues the clip with caption and hashtags.  
**Notes:** https://buffer.com — supports YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Twitter/X, LinkedIn. Evaluate against native platform APIs for upload reliability.

---

## Analytics / Optimize

### VidIQ
**Stage:** Optimize  
**Status:** CONSIDERING  
**Cost:** Free tier; Pro ~$7.50/mo  
**What it does:** YouTube analytics and SEO tool — keyword research, competitor analysis, tag suggestions, and performance tracking per video.  
**Pipeline fit:** Optimize stage — pull per-clip performance data (views, CTR, watch time) via API to feed back into scoring model and template parameters.  
**Notes:** https://vidiq.com — API access on paid tiers. Complements YouTube Analytics API data.

---

### TubeBuddy
**Stage:** Optimize  
**Status:** CONSIDERING  
**Cost:** Free tier; Pro ~$4.99/mo  
**What it does:** YouTube-focused browser extension and API for keyword research, A/B thumbnail testing, bulk processing, and analytics.  
**Pipeline fit:** Alternative or complement to VidIQ for keyword/tag optimization in the Optimize stage.  
**Notes:** https://www.tubebuddy.com — API available; evaluate alongside VidIQ to avoid paying for both.

---

## Competitive Reference

### Opus Clip
**Stage:** Reference  
**Status:** RESEARCH ONLY  
**Cost:** Free tier (limited); Pro ~$15–29/mo  
**What it does:** AI-powered tool that automatically identifies and extracts highlights from long-form video into short clips optimized for TikTok/Reels/Shorts. Adds captions, reframes to vertical, and scores each clip.  
**Pipeline fit:** Market leader in the exact problem space this bot is solving. Study for: clip selection scoring logic, caption style (word-highlight), vertical reframe quality, and UI/UX for review and approval.  
**Notes:** https://www.opus.pro — not a tool we integrate with; a product to analyze and learn from. Their "Clipping AI" scores clips on engagement potential — worth reverse-engineering the prompt strategy.  
**Reason not using:** External SaaS — we are building an equivalent system locally for control, cost, and customization.

---

### Descript
**Stage:** Reference  
**Status:** RESEARCH ONLY  
**Cost:** Free tier; Creator ~$24/mo  
**What it does:** Transcript-based video editor — edit video by editing the text transcript. Includes overdub (AI voice cloning), filler word removal, and caption generation.  
**Pipeline fit:** Study for: caption editing UX, transcript-synchronized clip trimming interface, and the overall paradigm of text-first video editing.  
**Notes:** https://www.descript.com — not integrated; reference for Manual Review UI design decisions.  
**Reason not using:** External SaaS; transcript-based editing UX is worth borrowing conceptually for our review interface.

---

### Captions App
**Stage:** Reference  
**Status:** RESEARCH ONLY  
**Cost:** Free tier; Pro ~$7/mo  
**What it does:** Mobile-first AI captions app with animated word-highlight style captions, auto-reframe, B-roll insertion, and clip trimming.  
**Pipeline fit:** Primary reference for the word-highlight caption style we want to implement — each word animates in sync with speech.  
**Notes:** https://www.captions.ai — mobile app (iOS/Android). Study caption animation timing, font choices, background pill/shadow styling, and line-break logic.  
**Reason not using:** Mobile-only; no API. Reference only for caption visual design.
